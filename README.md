# Effective Programming Techniques - laboratory classes
__stage of studies: 2nd year, 3rd semester__

Each lab class dir contains an implementation of tasks about the given topic.

* TEP_Lab1 - allocation and pointers
* TEP_Lab2 - operators overloading
* TEP_Lab3 - relationships between classes and objects
* TEP_Lab4 - template classes
* TEP_Lab5 - smart pointers and move semantics
* TEP_Proj - genetic algorithm (package "GeneticProject" was given for use by the lab class instructor)

_TEP\_Lab[number] is a two-week homework assignment.<br>_
_TEP\_Mod[number] is a live coding task called "modification" by the lab class instructor.<br>_
_Mods for Lab2, Lab3 and Lab5 can be found in their dirs or directly in the code (marked with a comment).<br>_
_TEP_Proj is a four-week homework assignment._
